# Satellite_Image_Classification

In this project, Satellite image is classified into buildings, water bodies, and vegetation. Manual classification by using image interpretation techniques require more time and field experts. So in this project, I focused on efficient automatic satellite image classification. Various machine learning algorithms like K-Means clustering, Support vector machine, Decision tree, and Random forest are used for feature extraction and classification of satellite images.
